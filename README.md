# 🎵 BAIS 3250: Data Wrangling Final Project — Spotify & Billboard Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes Spotify songs from 2010 to 2019 to identify correlations between audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, BPM) and songs that made it to the Billboard Hot 100 list of the decade.

## 🧠 Objective

To explore the relationship between Spotify audio features and the popularity of songs, as indicated by their presence on the Billboard Hot 100 list. The goal is to determine which audio characteristics are most associated with chart-topping hits.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment

## 📁 Project Structure

- `code/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for data analysis.
- `data/`: Includes the datasets used in the project.
- `results/`: Stores the output files, such as visualizations and summary tables.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Songs with higher danceability and energy scores tend to appear more frequently on the Billboard Hot 100 list.
- A moderate tempo (BPM) range is common among top-charting songs.
- Certain audio features, like acousticness and instrumentalness, show less correlation with chart success.
